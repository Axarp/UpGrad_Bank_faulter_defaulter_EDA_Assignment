The goal of this project is to identify patterns that indicate a client's difficulty in paying their loan installments. This analysis will help the bank take actions such as:

-  Denying loans to high-risk applicants.
-  Reducing the loan amount for applicants with moderate risk.
-  Lending to risky applicants at higher interest rates.
The ultimate aim is to ensure that capable consumers are approved for loans, thereby minimizing the risk of defaults.
